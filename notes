Style:

  - opening brace on line above
  - no macros, const or even constexpr for constants, inline functions
  - if always with braces
  - indentation 2 spaces, no tabs

Algorithm:

  - growth of buffer must be exponential, not just adding 1024 at a time
  - we probably want to use something that can to realloc internally
  - mutex for submit needed!
  - probably need to reduce work with memory_order_seq_cst
  - maxRetries much larger to wait out AWS delays
  - also look at work counter in the loop of getWork
  - in wait use a timeout of 0.1s for at least one thread, just in case
